1. Project about two groups of users of music app.

Tools: Python, Pandas

Yandex Music.
Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.
Using Yandex.Music data, you will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.
The purpose of the study is to test three hypotheses:
User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.
